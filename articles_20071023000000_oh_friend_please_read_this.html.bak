<!-- OH friend,  please read this! -->

<br />
I am convinced that there is a high cliff that many people are blindly marching toward and many have marched right off the edge oblivious to what is below,  but please be warned and listen.<br />
<br />
I am not going to argue the creation/evolution debate today.  We can do that another day.  I believe the Bible account of how we all got here.   God created man in His Own image.   We , humans, are his crowning creation.  In other words God created everything there is with us in mind.  The trees  the water the sun, stars, moon, all the other animals, insects, plants, for us and to draw us to Him.<br />
<br />
He gave us, humans,   the will to choose to acknowledge Him as God or not.   He created us to have a relationship with Him and to love Him as He loves us.   <br />
<br />
We know that you can’t force someone to love you.  When we truly  know someone, their character, what they like and what they don’t like,  and we experience their care and concern for us,  we are drawn to them emotionally, and that emotion grows into a love relationship.  In that love relationship there is a care and concern about the other person involved that makes you  want to please them above or before  yourself.    <br />
<br />
God has given us His laws for our own good.    These laws are opportunity for us to show our love for Him by obeying them.   These laws are also very good for us as  a society, even if we don’t acknowledge Him as our Loving God.   With HIS laws God has always given the consequences of breaking them.  Shortly after  the beginning, in the Garden of Eden, God had given Adam one law to follow.  God told Adam, all the  trees in the garden you can eat the fruit from them except one; don’t eat of the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden.  If you do  you will surely die.  God created Adam to physically live forever.  We know what happened, right.  Eve was tempted to eat of the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden, and did eat and gave some to Adam.  At that time their bodies started to die.   So from this point in time everything in the world started to  decay and die.  Just like God said.<br />
<br />
There are many other laws that God has given us.   There are ten of them especially. The Ten Commandments.   We used to know them.   They used to be in our schools and public places.   Now we have decided they are no good and started removing them.   After giving these laws God said obey these and do all that I command  and I will be your God and you will be my people.   Let’s just look at a few of them.  Can you  remember them?<br />
<br />
“YOU SHALL HAVE NO OTHER gods BEFORE ME”,  DON’T BOW DOWN TO WORSHIP ANYTHING BUT GOD”,  HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER,   YOU SHALL NOT MURDER, YOU SHALL NOT STEAL, YOU SHALL NOT LIE,.   <br />
<br />
This is not all of them but,  let’s just see how we are doing with these?   Be honest with yourself. Have you ever told a lie?  What does that make you?         A LIAR!        Have you ever stolen anything at all?      What does that make you ?    A THIEF!    Have you ever murdered anyone?     Most people will say  no to this one.    Jesus said in the SERMON ON THE MOUNT, Matthew 5,  If you are angry with your brother without cause you are in danger of the same judgment as a murderer.   You see anger motivates the murderer!   You see GOD knows your thoughts, and motivations behind every action.   Let me ask that question again.   Have you ever been really angry at someone,  are you a murderer at heart?<br />
<br />
Remember we are being honest with ourselves,  how many laws do you have to break to be considered a law-breaker.    One, right?    If you answered yes to any of the questions above you are a liar, a thief and a murderer at heart.  The Bible says that sin is breaking God’s law.   There is always a sentence or punishment for sin, (breaking the law).   Romans 6:23  The wages (what we have earned for our sin) is DEATH.    IF GOD WERE TO JUDGE YOU TODAY BY THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, WOULD YOU BE GUILTY OR INNOCENT?   WOULD YOU GO TO HEAVEN OR HELL?<br />
<br />
God is not an ogre waiting to smash us when we fail.   I told you before that God loves us and desires a personal relationship with each of us.  He really does!  God does not want anyone to go to hell, but that all should turn from their sin and trust HIM.  God is the very definition of love but  He is also a Righteous, and a Holy God.   He set the rules.   In Deuteronomy God said “I set before you life and death,  choose life!”  <br />
<br />
God knew, as humans, we could not keep His law.    There is price or a fine to pay for being a sinner.   John 3:16  FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD THAT HE GAVE HIS ONE AND ONLY SON, THAT WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT PERISH, BUT HAVE EVERLASTING LIFE.  This is where Jesus Christ comes in.    Remember,  He was born in Bethlehem.   He lived a perfect sinless life, and died on the cross to pay the price for all sin.   You see the price is paid for your sin, but you have to acknowledge your sin and accept this payment for your sin.<br />
<br />
O my friend, God loves you and is giving you time to repent or turn from your sin.   Please ask God to forgive you and make Him your first priority.  You will never regret it, I promise!  This is the most important decision you will ever make, and you have to make  it before you die.   HELL NEVER ENDS and is your worst nightmare!  <br />
<br />
O my friend my purpose is not to scare you but to warn you .   When you make the decision to accept JESUS CHRIST as your personal Savior,  you are adopted into God’s family.   Death has no sting to us.   Instead  of eternal punishment in hell, we have eternal life with Jesus and we can’t imagine how good it will be.  1Co 2:9 “But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.” <br />
<br />
Ok, now you  may not believe this at all,  but  if I am wrong, then I am the fool.   I can live with that.   If I am right and you die in your sin, you will remember reading this FOREVER, knowing you didn’t have to be in hell!<br />
<br />
O  MY FRIEND PLEASE CONSIDER THIS TODAY!  108 PEOPLE DIE EVERY MINUTE!<br />
<br />
We have much less to lose by being a nut for Jesus!    Thank you for reading this and I pray that God will reveal Himself to you!<br />
