      The Church is located 5 miles north of Pittsburg at the junction of highways 69 and 47.  Right at the south end of Franklin. Come by the church and let us give your vehicle a 20 point inspection to see if your car is ready for summer and your vacation!  You can have some ice water and a snack while we check your car.   When we are done you will receive a detailed work sheet to take to your mechanic if there are areas of concern with your car.  We will only inspect your vehicle.  We will not be doing any repairs at the church.  We are looking forward to seeing you there.
