Christmas Quiz<br />
1. Where was Mary when the angel Gabriel came to tell her that she would be the mother of Jesus?<br />
2. What question did Mary ask Gabriel?<br />
3. What was Mary’s response to Gabriel after he told her what was to happen?<br />
4. Why did Joseph have to go to Bethlehem?<br />
5. What did the angel say to the shepherds concerning the baby that was born in Bethlehem.<br />
 <br />
The answers to these questions are found in the Bible.<br />
The book of Luke chapters 1 and 2. I hope you enjoyed the quiz. The message to the shepherds was to FEAR NOT, THERE IS GOOD NEWS FOR ALL PEOPLE.<br />
THE SAVIOR OF THE WORLD IS COME TO SAVE THE PEOPLE FROM THEIR SIN.<br />
My question to you is are you a sinner? Have you ever told a lie? Have you ever stolen anything? Have you used God’s name as a curse word? This is only 3 of the ten commandments. The Bible says that breaking God’s law is sin, and that the wages of sin is an eternal death in hell. My question to you again is are you a sinner?<br />
If so I have great news! That is why Jesus Christ came to die in your place the death you deserved. So please remember Christ this Christmas and do have a MERRY CHRISTMAS!             <br />
