We attend NEW LIFE BAPTIST CHURCH, located 5 miles north of Pittsburg at the 69 47 highway junction.   This is at the South end of Franklin, KS.  <br />
<br />
We are a small Southern Baptist Church where we come together to worship our Savior, Jesus Christ, and encourage each other.  Randy Woods is the Pastor. <br />
<br />
Right now we are meeting at 10:00 am for Bible study and 10:45 am for Worship Service.   Sunday Evening we meet at 6:00 pm for Evening worship, and  Wednesday at 6:30 pm at the Arma Care Center.<br />
<br />
Feel free to come worship with us. <br />
