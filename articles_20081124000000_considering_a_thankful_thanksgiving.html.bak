CONSIDERING A THANKFUL THANKSGIVING<br />
<br />
	I don’t know what thoughts come to your mind when you consider THANKSGIVING AND THANKFULNESS, but for me I remember when I was little and many cousins aunts and uncles would get together.  Even today we still get some of the family together and this is good, these are more like a family reunions than really a time to consider our blessings.   <br />
	Webster defines thankfulness as warm friendly feelings of gratitude.   I can consider many things and people in my life that give me those warm friendly feelings of gratitude. There is one thing  that brings a much greater meaning than that to me.  You see I was once a convicted liar, thief, blasphemer, and an idol worshiper.  <br />
 Let me explain.    I have lied and stolen things, used GOD’S name as a curse word, and have placed myself above GOD.  These are only 4 of the ten commandments!  The Bible says that SIN  is breaking GOD’S LAW.   It also says that  the WAGES OF SIN is death!   <br />
It also says that all LIARS will  have their place in the lake of fire.  That is HELL!  <br />
You see I was in  BIG TROUBLE!  <br />
Did you notice that I said WAS?   I found another verse in the BIBLE.  Roman 6:23 says “THE WAGES OF SIN IS DEATH, BUT THE GIFT OF GOD IS ETERNAL LIFE THROUGH JESUS CHRIST OUR LORD.  You see I am now saved from the punishment of my sin, because JESUS DIED THE DEATH I DESERVED.    He died in my place.   Here is all I had to do.<br />
1.  I HAD TO RECOGNIZE THAT I WAS A DOOMED SINNER ON THE ROAD TO HELL.<br />
2. I THEN UNDERSTOOD THAT I NEEDED A SAVIOR<br />
	SOMEONE TO DO FOR ME WHAT I COULD NOT DO FOR MYSELF.<br />
	I COULD NEVER BE GOOD ENOUGH.<br />
3.  I TOLD  GOD THAT I WAS SORRY FOR MY SIN, AND ASKED HIM TO BE MY NEW 	BOSS.<br />
4.  I ASK GOD TO CREDIT THE DEATH OF JESUS CHRIST TO THE DEATH I 	DESERVED.<br />
5.  THEN I STOPPED PLANNING TO DO THE THINGS GOD CALLS  SIN.  <br />
6.  NOW I HAVE A HOME IN HEAVEN WAITING FOR ME, <br />
	GUARANTEED BY CHRIST.<br />
FOR THIS I HAVE MORE THAN WARM FRIENDLY FEELINGS,<br />
I AM ETERNALLY GRATEFUL!<br />
<br />
I HOPE YOU ARE TOO.   HAVE A HAPPY THANKSGIVING<br />
