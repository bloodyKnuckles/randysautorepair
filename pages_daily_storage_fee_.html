<!-- DAILY STORAGE FEE  -->
<!-- 20080507000000 -->

Since we have limited parking available to us, we are forced to institute a policy that our customers pick up there vehicles in a timely manner when the work is completed.   After repairs are completed you have 2 weeks to come and pick up your vehicle.  After 2 weeks we will send you a letter or call you reminding you your car is ready to be picked up.  After a total of 4 weeks,after the repairs are completed on your car, we will add a storage fee of $10 per day going back to the day the repairs are completed. The only exception to this will be if arrangements are made before repairs are completed to your car. Please pick up your vehicle in a timely manner so we won't have to charge you a massive storage bill.
