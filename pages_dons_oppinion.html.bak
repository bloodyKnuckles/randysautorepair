Randy and his staff are each professionals. I have known Randy and his<br />
family for 18 years and may I stress: they are FAIR, HONEST and TRUSTWORTHY.<br />
They are knowledgeable of all brands of vehicles including my Dodge<br />
Caravans. If Randy or his staff suggest something, listen - they're only<br />
trying to help you. You get more than "Auto Repair", you get "Service."<br />
