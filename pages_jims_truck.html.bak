HI, RODNEY AND RANDY:<br />
I HAVE MANY PROBLEMS WITH MY TRUCK, PERHAPS THE GREATEST IS THE GRINDING IN ALL GEARS.  OTHER PROBLEMS ARE AS FOLLOWS:<br />
NEEDS NEW SEAT BELT CLIP.<br />
DRIVERS SIDE DOOR (You have to know how to open it from the outside)<br />
PASSENGER DOOR  (You have to know how to open it from the inside)<br />
GLOVE COMPARTMENT DOOR:<br />
(You know the last 3 Chevy’s I’ve owned have had the glove compartment door lock fall off.)<br />
WINDSHIELD LEAKS  (THOUGH NOT AS MUCH AS BEFORE I PUT THE GUNK ON IT.)<br />
PARKING BRAKE CABLE BROKE  (ABOUT THE 2ND YEAR I OWNED IT.)<br />
NEEDS A COUPLE OF NEW TIRES.<br />
IT HAS 140,000 MILES ON IT.<br />
IT’S TOO SMALL FOR MY SON TO GET BEHIND THE WHEEL ( I DON’T KNOW IF THAT IS A PROBLEM OR NOT!)<br />
IF YOU DON’T HAVE TIME TO LOOK AT IT RIGHT NOW (I’ve driven the truck for a few months now with these problems, I guess I can drive it a while longer.)<br />
