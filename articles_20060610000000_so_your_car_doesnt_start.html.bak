<h2>So, Your Car Doesn't Start?</h2><br />
<br />
<strong style="color: red;">WARNING:</strong>  WITHOUT A BASIC KNOWLEDGE OF CARS AND COMPONENTS OF CARS; DON'T TRY THESE JUST CALL US.<br />
<br />
These will be divided into two groups:<br />
<strong>1. ENGINE WON'T CRANK</strong>, and<br />
<strong>2. ENGINE CRANKS BUT WON'T START</strong><br />
<br />
1. ENGINE WON'T CRANK<br />
When you turn the key into the start position and the starter does not make any or very little sound at all, this is a no CRANK condition.  <br />
<br />
<br />
2. ENGINE CRANKS BUT WON'T START<br />
When you turn the key into the start position,<br />
the starter turns the engine over (engine cranks) and the engine does not start running, this is a cranks but won't START condition. <br />
  <br />
<br />
<strong>1. ENGINE WON'T CRANK</strong><br />
Look for the yellow indicator on the dash that says theft or security.  If it is on or flashing WHILE IN THE CRANK POSITION there may be a failure in the theft system.  These systems vary greatly.  Wait 10 minutes and try a different key.  If the yellow security indicator is still on,  call us.<br />
<br />
Turn your headlights on. Do they come on?<br />
<strong>NO</strong>—check for loose battery connections, if ok try jump starting.   <br />
<br />
<strong>YES</strong>—if the lights come on but go out when  turning key to the CRANK POSITION.  There is a bad connection at the battery or weak battery.   <br />
<br />
If they stay on when key is turned to the start position. Try tapping on the starter motor while having someone else hold the key in the start position.  If the engine starts the starter needs replacing. Now while it is running drive it to our shop, or somewhere to get the starter replaced. This will save you the price of towing.  If it doesn't  start call us.  <br />

<strong>2. ENGINE CRANKS BUT WON'T START</strong><br />
<br />
<strong style="color: red;">WARNING:</strong> YOU MUST USE CAUTION HERE, IF THE ENGINE HAS BEEN RUNNING THE EXHAUST COULD BE HOT.   IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE FUEL TANK FROM THE MUFFLER, DON'T DO THIS, CALL US!!<br />
<br />
If you can locate the fuel tank under the car, slap the bottom of the fuel tank with your hand or something else to jar the fuel pump in the fuel tank.  Be careful not to dent or puncture the fuel tank.  This is most effective if you have someone cranking the engine and someone else slapping the fuel tank.  If the fuel pump is the reason for the no start, slapping the tank could make the fuel pump start working.   <br />
