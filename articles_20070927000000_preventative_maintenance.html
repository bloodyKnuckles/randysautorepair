<!-- Preventative Maintenance -->

<h2>PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE</h2>Before the cold of winter gets here it is always a good idea to get your car checked over.  While getting your car checked over  does not insure that you won't have car trouble, it does give you an idea of the condition of your car.   This gives you  opportunity to get  areas of concern fixed before winter.  If you look in your glove box more than  likely there is an owners manual for your car. It will tell you  how to operate and maintain your car.   It discusses the maintenance that your car requires occasionally, and answers to some of the questions you may have about your car.<br />
<br />
It is a good idea to plan ahead and prepare for winter.  <strong>It is even more important to prepare for something else.</strong>  In fact it is a matter of LIFE and DEATH.  Are you prepared for death?  It is a crucial to think about this before you die.  We will all die sometime.  Death and taxes are two very sure things in this life.   Have you considered what happens after you die?  Here are some good questions to ask yourself.<br />
<br />
1.  Is there a God?   <br />
2.  Does God care about right and wrong?<br />
3.  Are God's standards the same as ours?  <br />
4.  Will God punish sin?  <br />
5.  Is there a hell?<br />
6.  Can you avoid hell by living a good life?<br />
<br />
God has left us a manual for this life.   It discusses how we got here, why we are here, what happens after death and what happens in the future.  It tells us how to get the most out of this life and the next life.   The Bible is God's Holy inspired Word.   <br />
<br />
The answers to the questions above are as follows.  <br />
<br />
Yes, there is a God.  <br />
Yes, He cares about right and wrong.  <br />
No, God's standards are not the same as ours.  <br />
Yes, God will punish sin.  <br />
Yes, there is a hell.  <br />
No, you can not avoid hell by living a good life.   <br />
<br />
Have you ever told a lie?  What does that make you?-----------A LIAR<br />
<br />
Have you ever stolen anything at all?  What does that make you?-------A THIEF<br />
<br />
These are only 2 of the ten commandments that God has given us. Sin is breaking God's law.<br />
<br />
If you answered yes to any of  these questions, YOU ARE A SINNER.  If you answered no to these 2 there are 8 others that  I didn't even mention.   Romans 3:23 says we are all sinners and we fall short of God's standard.   If God were to judge you today by the ten commandments.  Would you  be innocent or guilty?   Would you go to heaven, being guilty?   Romans 10:9 says "There is none who lives right, no not one!"   You see, before a HOLY AND RIGHTEOUS GOD WE ARE ALL GUILTY.  WE ALL DESERVE GOD'S ANGER AND PUNISHMENT! Let's be very clear on this point.  IF YOU DIE A GUILTY SINNER YOU WILL GO TO HELL AND  YOU WILL BE THERE FOREVER!  <br />
<br />
<strong>There is some good news after all this bad news.</strong>   God knew we could not be righteous as He is righteous.    God sent His only Son, Jesus Christ, to take the wrath and anger that we deserved upon Himself.  Jesus dying on the cross paid the fine for our sin.  Jesus was the only one who could pay the price.<br />
<br />
So, what do we do now?  WE STOP DOING THE THINGS THAT ANGER GOD, ASK GOD TO FORGIVE US, AND MAKE JESUS OUR #1 PRIORITY.   Then our death experience  will no longer include HELL!  We can look forward to being accepted by God.  We are adopted into His family.  The Bible says we can't even imagine how good  heaven is going to be!<br />
<br />
Please consider this.  Preventative maintenance is good for your car and also your soul.  God loves all of us!  Making Jesus your # 1 priority has its rewards!   After all,  having our sins forgiven and not going to hell is reason enough  to try to please God with our every breath,  don't you think?   Grab a Bible, ask God to help you understand it, and read, read, read.   It is the most amazing book in the world.  <br />
